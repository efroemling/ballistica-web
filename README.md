# Ballistica Web Front-End

This will hopefully mutate into a useful toolset for Ballistica related functionality (wrangling mods, cloud hosting, asset packages, etc). For now though it is largely just me learning Angular/Material.

This was shamelessly spun off from the [Source Code](https://github.com/angular/material.angular.io) for the [Angular Material Documentation Site](https://material.angular.io/).
