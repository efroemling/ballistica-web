   'desc':'I\'ve been getting a lot of requests for this, so at long last there is an official BombSquad/Ballistica Discord Server. Lots of modders and community members have joined already and I\'ll be hopping on periodically (including weekly scheduled office-hours time) so its a great resource to ask questions or share fun stuff you\'ve made.'

   'title':'BombSquad 1.7 is Here!!!!',
    'date':'July 13, 2022',
    'desc':'The rollout is still only set to 5% of the full user base to give me time to fix any bugs, but it\'s also rolled out to the open testing track. If you\'re running the Google Play version and want to join that.'
  },
  {
    'title':'Workspaces',
    'date':'July 1, 2022',
    'desc':'The new 1.7 workspaces functionality is finally live. This includes both the simple web editing front end and the bacloud command line tool for interacting with them from a computer. Please holler if you run into any issues or have any feedback. My next priority will be getting 1.7 builds pushed out to Google Play, etc. so that people don\'t need to grab test builds to play with this stuff.'

    'title':'Python 3.10',
    'date':'June 1, 2022',
    'desc':'To go along with the imminent 1.7 release, Ballistica has been upgraded from Python 3.9 to 3.10. This means we\'re using the latest and greatest available. I\'ve also improved my back-end pipeline to be less dependent on OS Python versions, meaning we are free to upgrade Ballistica\'s Python version yearly in sync with Python itself instead of waiting for Ubuntu LTS updates or whatnot (though I expect we\'ll still wait a few months after new Python releases to allow tools support to mature/etc).'
